# Plant Seedling Classification Project

## Project Overview

This project focuses on classifying images of plant seedlings into different species using deep learning techniques. The dataset consists of images from various plant species, and the goal is to develop an accurate model that can identify the species based on the visual features in these images.

The project is divided into two notebooks, each representing an iterative improvement in the approach to classification.

## Key Steps in the Project

### Notebook 1: Initial Classification Approach
1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**
   - Load the dataset and preprocess images (resizing, normalization).
   - Split the data into training, validation, and test sets.

2. **Model Architecture**
   - Implement a basic Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification.
   - Use Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, and Dense layers to build the model.

3. **Training and Evaluation**
   - Train the CNN model and evaluate performance using metrics such as accuracy and loss.
   - Analyze performance and identify areas for improvement.

4. **Initial Challenges**
   - Discuss challenges encountered with the initial model, such as overfitting or underfitting.

### Notebook 2: Improved Classification Approach
1. **Enhanced Data Augmentation**
   - Apply advanced data augmentation techniques (e.g., rotation, flipping, scaling) to increase the robustness of the model.

2. **Refined Model Architecture**
   - Develop a more complex CNN architecture with additional layers, dropout, and batch normalization to improve performance.
   - Explore transfer learning with pre-trained models like VGG16 or ResNet for feature extraction.

3. **Hyperparameter Tuning**
   - Perform hyperparameter tuning to optimize learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs.

4. **Model Performance and Results**
   - Evaluate the improved model on validation and test datasets.
   - Compare results with the initial approach and discuss improvements in accuracy and other metrics.

5. **Final Insights**
   - Summarize the improvements made, the impact on classification accuracy, and provide recommendations for further enhancements.
